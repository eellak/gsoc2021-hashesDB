# hashesDB
hashesDB will be a command line tool that will help users manage a database of hashes of files. It will provide several database-related functionalities such as insertion, deletion and searching. It will also support fuzzy hashing, a hashing technique based on Locality-Sensitive Hashing that makes it possible to perform similarity checking with the use of hashing.

# My Progression
I regularly add logs that briefly describe the project's progression in [this](https://github.com/gkosm314/gsoc2021-hashesDB/wiki/Project-Journal) page.
